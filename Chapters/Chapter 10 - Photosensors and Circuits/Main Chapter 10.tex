\section{Photosensors and circuits}

This chapter is a sort of culmination of everything we've learnt. It is also, in my opinion the most dense and challenging to understand. Throughout writing it, I have tried my best to only give the necessary information and avoid overload of details.

Before starting, it is critical to make sure you understand well the following concepts covered previously: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The PN Junction and Diode. 
\end{itemize}
