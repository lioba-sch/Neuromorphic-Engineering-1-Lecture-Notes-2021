\subsection{Test Yourself}

This chapter being quite dense, you should expect general knowledge questions about the content. 

Here is a list of things you should know about this chapter for the exam: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the energy of a photon of a given wavelength?
    \item How does photo-transduction occur in silicon, i.e. how are electrons generated and how are they collected in a PN junction?
    \item What is Quantum Efficiency (QE)?
    \item How does the I-V curve of a diode change in the presence of light?
    \item How does absorption length of photons change with wavelength over the visible and near infrared range?
    \item How can you build a simple logarithmic photoreceptor?
    \item How you can use adaptation in a feedback loop to cancel out circuit mismatch.
    \item How you can build a fast logarithmic current-sense amplifier, by using feedback to make a virtual ground.
    \item How you can use a capacitive divider in the feedback loop of an amplifier to set a gain.
    \item How you can use a cascode configuration to increase effective drain resistance.
    \item What is the Miller effect?
    \item How can a cascode can be used to reduce it?
\end{itemize}
