\subsection{Test yourself}
You should be able to answer the following things: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain what the Early effect is, why it's important and when one should pay attention to it.
    \item Understand how a diode-connected transistor function, both through nFET and pFET!
    \item Draw a current mirror, and qualitatively explain how it works and the assumptions taken to derive the behaviour. 
    \item Draw a differential pair, and qualitatively describe its functioning. sketch the I-V relationship between the input voltage difference and output currents. 
    \item Draw a current correlator, and qualitatively describe its functioning
    \item Qualitatively describe the functioning of a bump antibump circuit
\end{itemize}
