\subsection{Test Yourself}

You should be able to answer the following questions for the exam (mainly taken from the winter study sheet).

\begin{itemize}
    \item The schematic for a synapse circuit.
    \item How the synaptic current changes as a function of the presynaptic frequency and the synaptic weight.
    \item How the firing frequency of an adaptive neuron changes as a function of the presynaptic frequency and the biases to the adapting synapse.
    \item Which differential equation describes the output current of the DPI synapse? Under which condition does it hold?
    \item What are the advantages of using two separate transistors for the input pulse?
    \item How can we implement short-term depression?
    \item What is the disadvantage of the Log-domain pulse integrator?
\end{itemize}
