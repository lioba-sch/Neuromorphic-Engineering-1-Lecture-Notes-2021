\subsubsection{The Perceptron}\label{sec:perceptron}

As we have seen in section \ref{sec:neurons_synapses}, the basic functionality of a neuron is to sum up the synaptic inputs it receives from its dendrites and generate an output if the inputs cross a threshold value. The first mathematical model of this functionality was introduced in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. The McCulloch-Pitts model is considered the first artificial neuron. Its structure is demonstrated in figure .
