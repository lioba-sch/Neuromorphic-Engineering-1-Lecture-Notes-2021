\subsection{Test yourself}
You should know and understand the following things: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structure of Silicon.
    \item Difference between conductors, semi conductors and insulators on an atomic perspective, and with some intuition about the band energy diagrams.
    \item The idea of doping, how that changes conductivity and band energy diagrams.
    \item The idea behind the PN Junction and the dynamic it creates (depletion, electric field etc..).
    \item How the diode works, and the principle of forward vs reverse bias mode. 
    \item The idea behind the MIS Capacitance structure and its operating modes as a function of gate voltage.
    \item What $\kappa$ represents and how it relates the change in surface potential vs gate voltage. 
\end{itemize}
