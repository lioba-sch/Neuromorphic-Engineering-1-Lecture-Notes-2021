\section{Silicon Neurons}

In the previous chapter, we introduced a biologically plausible circuit that models the behaviour of a cortical synapse. Synapses are responsible for transmitting information between neurons. Neurons themselves act as integrator circuits that integrate over their inputs and generate an action potential once their integrated input crosses a threshold. Figure \ref{fig:action_potential} in section \ref{sec:neurons_synapses} visualized the typical course of an action potential. Let's have a look how we can model an equivalent behaviour with our VLSI circuits.

In this chapter, we introduced silicon neuron circuits for both a conductance-based neuron model as well as a less complex integrate-and-fire neuron model. Traditionally, these are the two main classes of neuron models. In recent years, however, there have been advances to bridge the gap between both classes and generalized integrate-and-fire neuron models have been introduced. These models are able to model many aspects of the complex behaviour of conductance-based neurons while maintain their rather simple structure. This is not relevant for the exam but an interesting outlook onto future research.
