\subsection{Test Yourself}

You should be able to answer the following questions for the exam (mainly taken from the winter study sheet).

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is a neuron and what are its components (synapse, soma, dendrite)?
    \item What types of models are used to simulate neurons?
    \item How does the spike-generating mechanism work?
    \item What is an FI curve?
    \item Can you draw the circuit schematic of the axon-hillock neuron?
    \item What are the components of the conductance-based neuron?
    \item What is its disadvantage?
    \item How can we implement a time delay?
    \item Why do we need a positive feedback in the axon-hillock circuit?
    \item What is the drawback of the circuit's initial amplifier and how does it occur?
\end{itemize}
