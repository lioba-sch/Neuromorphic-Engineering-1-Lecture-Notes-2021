\subsection{Things you should know}

Here is a list of things you should know about this chapter for the exam: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item How to compute the time-constant of a low-pass filter and how to estimate it from measurements.
    \item How to change the time constant of a follower integrator circuit.
    \item What it means to use a lowpass filter as integrator and highpass filter as differentiator
    \item Why the differentiator and integrator are not actually real but only an approximation over some frequencies defined by the time constant.
    \item How to sketch the transfer function of a differentiator circuit, showing the time constant on the sketch. 
    \item How to implement a simple follower-differentiator
    \item How these circuits behave when driven with large signals
\end{itemize}
