\section*{Disclaimer}
These lecture notes were originally written to help the authors consolidate in a "stupid-proof" manner the content of the fascinating but very challenging Neuromorphic Engineering 1 (NE1) course. They are also meant to help other students of the current or following years to digest the content of the NE1 lectures, to prepare for the exam and, hopefully,  better appreciate the subtleties of the field. They are almost exclusively based on the content taught during Fall 2021 by Prof. Shi-Chii Liu, Prof. Tobi Delbruck \& Prof. Giacomo Indiveri at ETHZ. \textbf{We do not claim originality nor completeness}. The containing information is thus freely gathered and often copied word-by-word from the lecture materials or the "Analog VLSI" textbook \footnote{https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/analog-vlsi} written by the previously mentioned professors and others (we generally refer to this as the "Textbook"). These lecture notes also reproduce content from other sources such as books, blogs, papers, videos etc... We tried to always cite our references when they did not come directly from the Textbook or Lecture Notes.
